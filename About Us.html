			<p><justify>JSLB has been part of the global community since 2000, supporting high quality research
							and learning that transforms society and our understanding of individuals, groups, and cultures. JSLB
							is the independent, innovative, natural home for authors, editors and societies who share our
							commitment and passion for the society.  JSLB is based upon mat experiences in research as an organization. The
							difficulties I faced in understanding research as a student, my discoveries about what was applicable and
							inapplicable in the field an organization, and her development of the ability effectively to communicate
							difficult concepts in simple language without sacrificing technicality and accuracy as an organization have
							become the basis of her existence.Research methodology is taught as a supporting subject in several ways in many academic disciplines
							such as health, education, psychology, social work, nursing, public health, library studies and marketing
							research. The core philosophical base for this organization comes from her conviction that, although these
							disciplines vary in content, their broad approach to a research enquiry is similar. This organization, therefore,
							addressed academic and non academic disciplines.</justify></p>
